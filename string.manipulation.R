#String Manipulation

# String is traditionally a sequence of characters, as some kind of variable. 
# A string is generally understood as a data type and is often implemented 
# as an array of bytes (or words) that stores a sequence of elements, 
# typically characters, using some character encoding. 

# String manipulation is the action of the fundamental operations on strings, 
# including their creation, concatenation, the extraction of string segments, 
# string matching, their comparison, discovering their length, replacing substrings 
# by other strings, storage, and input/output..
